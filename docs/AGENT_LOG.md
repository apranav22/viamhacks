# Agent log

Append-only. One entry per session or event, newest last, each starting with the identity one-liner from `AGENTS.md`:
`[tool/model · op <human> · <host> · <branch> · HH:MM]`. Log: work started/finished, `ARM: taken` / `ARM: released`,
machine config changes (before → after, how to revert), handoffs.

Arm sessions (operator go-ahead each time; teleop off, arm-still check before every run): checkpoint search in front of
the webcam, jaw-axis test, 10-view capture sweep holding a socket screw, base sweeps to locate the webcam. Arm left at
home, gripper open. ARM: released.

CONFIG: `overview-cam` attributes YUYV 640×480 → MJPEG 1920×1080 (30 fps). Full backup:
`sorter/config_backups/before_cam1080_142629.json` on Ali's laptop. Revert: set `format` YUYV, `width_px` 640,
`height_px` 480.

Wrote `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, this log, `docs/DATA_PLAN.md`. Open: re-measure the webcam (moved to a tripod) and redo
the capture views over the reject compartment; `config/checkpoint.json` is stale until then.

[claude-code/claude-opus-5-5 · op Ali · ali-macbook · ali/pipeline · 14:50]
ARM: taken (Ali: "take the arm, it's all yours"). Teleop off, arm at home. Plan: calibrate the raised webcam from
fingertip positions (empty gripper, grid over the reject compartment), then re-find the capture views holding a part.
Decision (Ali): reject = the NEAR compartment (x ≈ 245–370), good = far (x ≈ 410–545).

[claude-code/claude-opus-5-5 · op Ali · ali-macbook · ali/pipeline · 14:55]
Webcam calibrated (DLT from 18 fingertip positions): lens (-101, -206, 347), looking +x, 8° down. Checkpoint over the
reject compartment at TCP (285, -150, 260), 5 views recorded with joints in `config/checkpoint.json`. Picked the taped
socket screw from the pad with Pranav's grasp steps (poses.json unchanged except pick_region limited to the pad) and put
it back. Obstacles in `config/obstacles.json`. Arm at the watch pose over the pad (200, 310, 330), gripper open.
Timing: lift → first view 4.0 s (planner), view → view 0.5–0.75 s, checkpoint → good 7.3 s (planner chose a wrapped
joint-1 config): both long legs must become recorded joint moves.
